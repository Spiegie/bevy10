In Spaceship Lander, you become a skilled mercenary, piloting a versatile Spaceship and a nimble Lander in the midst of a galactic war.

The Azirul and the Tlen-tak, two powerful factions, are locked in a brutal conflict spanning a vast system. As a mercenary, you have the freedom to decide who you’ll fight for, whether it's the technologically advanced Azirul or the relentless Tlen-tak.

No matter which side you choose, your missions will be varied and challenging. You’ll deliver vital supplies, reinforce armies, evacuate the wounded, or unleash strategic bombardments on hostile planets. Each battlefield presents unique challenges, as you’ll be landing on different planets throughout the star system, where diverse terrains and environments keep you on your toes.

## Mission types

In Spaceship lander, there are different Mission types:

1. Supply / Reinforcement
- As war rages on distant planets, the front lines are desperate for supplies and fresh troops. Your mission is to fly into the heart of the conflict, navigating treacherous terrain and enemy fire, to deliver crucial supplies or reinforcements to ground forces. Speed and precision are key - delay could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

2. Exfiltrate / Search and Rescue
- When a mission goes south or a key asset needs to be extracted, you're the one they call. Land your ship in hostile territory to retrieve wounded soldiers, valuable intelligence, or high-profile individuals. With enemies closing in, you'll need to execute a flawless extraction and get your crew back to safety under heavy fire.

3. Stealth Infiltrate / Sabotage
- Not every mission is about brute force. Some require finesse and cunning. Slip past enemy defenses and land undetected behind enemy lines. Your goal is to insert special forces, sabotage key installations, or gather critical intel. Any detection could trigger alarms, turning your covert operation into a desperate fight for survival.

4. Bombardment
- When the situation on the ground becomes dire, the call for orbital support goes out. As the pilot of a heavily armed Lander, your task is to rain destruction on key enemy positions. Precision is crucial - you’ll need to deliver your payload without harming friendly forces or key assets.

5. Reconnaissance
- Intelligence is the backbone of any military operation. Fly to uncharted or enemy-controlled territories to gather vital information. Whether it’s mapping enemy defenses, identifying weak points, or scouting for future missions, your ability to remain undetected will determine the success of this mission.

6. Escort
- Sometimes, your mission is to protect rather than destroy. Escort vital convoys, VIPs, or other ships across dangerous territory. The enemy will do everything in their power to take down your charges, so you’ll need to stay vigilant and be ready to fight off any attacks.

7. Defensive Hold
- When the enemy launches a counterattack, your mission is to hold the line. Land on a strategically important location and use your Lander’s firepower to fend off waves of enemy forces. Your success could turn the tide of the battle, buying time for reinforcements to arrive.
