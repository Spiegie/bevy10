In Spaceship Lander, you become a skilled mercenary, piloting a versatile Spaceship and a nimble Lander in the midst of a galactic war.

The Azirul and the Tlen-tak, two powerful factions, are locked in a brutal conflict spanning a vast system. As a mercenary, you have the freedom to decide who you’ll fight for, whether it's the technologically advanced Azirul or the relentless Tlen-tak.

No matter which side you choose, your missions will be varied and challenging. Deliver vital supplies, reinforce armies, evacuate the wounded, or unleash strategic bombardments on hostile planets. Your Lander, equipped with light armaments and bombs, will be your key to success in these intense war zones.

Outfit your ship with a wide range of equipment to gain the upper hand in battle. Scavenge advanced systems from the battlefield or purchase upgrades to enhance your ship’s capabilities. Whether it’s more powerful weapons, better armor, or advanced navigation systems, the right equipment can make all the difference.

But it’s not just your ship that matters—your crew plays a crucial role too. The abilities and experience of your crew will directly impact the performance of your Lander and Spaceship. Assemble a team that complements your playstyle, whether you need expert gunners, skilled engineers, or brave medics to handle the heat of battle.

Prepare for a thrilling mix of choice, strategy, and action in Spaceship Lander, where both your ship and your crew determine your fate!
